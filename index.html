      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Tristyn, but I go by Tessa to avoid the confusion of being called "Justin" or "Christian".</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised all over Texas, but have spent most of my years in Downtown Dallas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I collect vintage and Japanese toys, mainly from animes created in the 80s and 90s. I am an avid fan of Gundams and Mechas, Japanese Monsters, and Dinosaurs (which I strongly believe are birds)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ideally I would like to pilot a Gundam, but more realistically I would like to write graphic novels for a living</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am a creature of habit, and don't stray very far from my comfort zone, so I still reside in Downtown Dallas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have an artistic personality, but not an artistic brain. I think very technically and prefer thinking ahead and solving problems than freely creating something from nothing. A lack of structure seriously stresses me out! Web Develpment allows me to satisfy both of my interests, art and tech, by allowing me to create in a way my brain can process efficiently</p>
